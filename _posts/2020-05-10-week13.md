## Thoughts on "Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert

Dries Buytaert makes some interesting points in his article, *Thoughts on "Makers and Takers"*. From my understanding, he explains how we can begin using open source and how it works when large companies are invovled. However, he describes it as "how we can make it easier to scale and sustain Open Source projects, Open Source companies and Open Source ecosystems". I learned a lot from what he explained, such as the makers and takers. I was unaware that there were other companies that contributed to larger companies, such as Red Hat assisting Linux. However, now I understand that these "maker" companies are dedicated to specific open source tasks (the writing of documentation, fixing bugs, etc). It became more clear to me when I read, "...Makers directly invest in growing both their business and the Open Source project. Takers are solely focused on growing their business and let others take care of the Open Source project they rely on." He explains the dynamic of makers and takers and the possible outcomes of when they contribute, such as when he uses the *Prisoner's Dilemma"* method. Overall, I do agree with most of the points he makes within his post. It is important to have a good balance between makers and takers (especially takers in my opinion). If makers and takers were to find a good balance, and had a fair amount of contributions, then open source could possibly be used more.

## The Chronicles of freeCodeCamp

Last week, our team was the first to begin the final presentations regarding our semester long projects. We were nervous at first as we did not know whether or not each person had to use all 12 minutes to present. However, we managed to pull it off. We prepared by **a lot** of communication through messenger as well as a mock presentation through Zoom. We were also fairly concerned as we did not hear from Troy whatsoever (we hope he is doing okay!). Overall, Jared, Erick and I believe to have made progress in freeCodeCamp given the fact that not one of us were familiar with JavaScript whatsoever.

As I described in the presentation, the progress I have personally made recently is:

1. Closed captions to [How to Create a Custom WordPress Theme - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5094&v=-h7gOJbIpmo)
2. Closed captions to [Build and deploy a portfolio website [Full Tutorial Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2725&v=_xkSvufmjEs)
3. Closed captions to [Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow 2 - Beginner's Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1452&v=B2q5cRJvqI8)
4. **Currently** reviewing [TensorFlow 2.0 Complete Course - Python Neural Networks for Beginners Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPYj3fFJGjk) (this is 6 hours & 52 minutes long!)

**[My contributions page on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?o=U&ar=1589147032078)**; however, I am not sure if anyone can access this page. This is what it looks like from my end:

I learned that this was a way to contribute through [their "Contribution Guidelines" page](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/).

However, they do not really speak any further about contributing closed captions beyond that, even in their [contributing guidelines webpage](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/index).
There is a [page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-the-freecodecamp-community-youtube-channel-b86bce4c865/) where it teaches and shows you how to add subtitles to their videos, but that is as far as it goes.
