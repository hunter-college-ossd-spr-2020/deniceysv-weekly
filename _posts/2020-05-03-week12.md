## Tom Callaway's *Musings on business models for open source software*

I found Tom Callaway's article to be very informative. I was unaware of the different models businesses use to incorporate any form of open source. In all honesty, I was introduced to open source only when I began taking this course, so I did not know how others outside of this course used it. Callaway explains that "open core" is used by many companies due to the fact that it sells proprietary software as their main product in addition to their core codebase which is open source. However, he explains that the most successful company is Red Hat, which also happens to be the company he works for, but they do not use open core. Callaway explains why Red Hat is so successful – they accomodate to their customers as well as their open source community. They genuinely care about their customers and their community that they want to deliver the very best content to them. He states, "The open source model allows for us to leverage a development pool far beyond what we can staff in house, incorporate the improvements of the participants in that community, and **deliver offerings to our customers that put them entirely in control."** I completely agree with their tactic. Personally, it seems as though they really care about their customers, which is valid because they are esentially the ones who contribute to their work. They are the ones who use their product.

## Would you want to work in a company that only produced open source software?

Yes, if I was offered a position to work in a company that only produced open source software, then I would definitely take it. I like the idea of a project to be available for just about anyone to access it. I have learned from being in this class that one should not be scared or nervous to contribute to an open source project. I like the idea that each individual may be at a different level than you and may have different skills and talents. I personally believe that I could learn as I work if I were to work at a company that solely produced open source software.

## Election fraud: Is there an open source solution?

Since the first time I voted, I have always wondered why there was not an option to vote online, especially with the technology we have today. After reading this article, I learned that the voting machines are ridiculously old and outdated or are running software that was set to expire earlier this year. Thus, I do believe that this could be a great solution to the voting problem we have today. Many cannot make it to the polls due to old age, long lines, and so on. However, I do have some questions – can anyone contribute to this up and coming project? What if they are biased? While I do believe that this is a great idea, I think that there are some bumps along the road that they could run into.

## The Chronicles of freeCodeCamp

* I *FINALLY* was able to find something to contribute to! 
  * This week, I learned how to add closed captions to their [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ).
  * I submitted my first closed caption contribution earlier today! Now I am just waiting for feedback. I believe it needs to get reviewed by an authorative figure then it will be reviewed by another contributor. The only issue I ran into was that I had a difficult time trying to understand some words that Andrew said. I had to rewind and play it back multiple times, so I myself may have made some errors.

 * I am currently working on another closed caption contribution for [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=601&v=_xkSvufmjEs).

 * I then plan to review others' closed caption submissions.
 * Hopefully I have extra time before our presentation to write more closed captions for one last video.
