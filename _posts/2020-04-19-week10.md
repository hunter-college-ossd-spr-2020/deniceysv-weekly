## Gil Yehuda's Talk

When I learned that Gil Yehuda was going to be a guest speaker in our class, I decided to do some research on him. I found his [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gil-Yehuda) page to be was incredibly resourceful – it is filled of tons of questions that he has answered. Gil is the senior director of technology strategy and open source for Verizon. I found Gil's talk to be extremely informative, especially when it came to his interview advice. What I found most valuable was when he said to speak about an open source project that the company you are interviewing for is involved in. Something that I found relatively comforting was when he spoke about *imposter syndrome*. He claims that everyone in the field has it, yet we are unaware because many are good at masking it. 

## Covid19 – Folding@home

I found this article to be very educational. I was actually a pre-med (biology) major before I made the switch to computer science, so I really enjoyed reading and learning from Folding@home. It is true that there are so many hidden information, such as chemicals, within a protein. I think their idea of creating a simulation to capture the motion of a protein and displaying a linear line of the acids is a great idea. It is s step forward to finding a solution to the coronavirus. I decided to download their software to help contribute to their project. I am excited to see their progress, especially if it can help with such a large cause that is affecting the world.

## The Chronicles of freeCodeCamp

Our team has finally made our first couple of pull requests! 

Erick made a pull request a few days ago where he corrected some typos and cleaned up a few grammatical errors so that it had a more natural tone to it. He notified us on Friday (April 17) that it was finally accepted and merged!

While Jared and I worked on [issue #38329](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38329) together, which we were able to issue a pull request this morning (April 19)! We believe that they are currently running the build and checking it as it as not been approved and merged yet.

I have also finished my Tagalog translation for their documenation; however, I am hesitant to issue a pull request as I know that they will probably not approve of it until next year. I am going to talk to Troy about this because I know he is working on a Turkish translation. 

I have also decided that I am no longer going to go through a sequential checklist. I would rather take each step with my contributions at my own pace. After listening to Gil's presentation, it really helped me learn what I want to do with this project and how I want to contribute. As Jared and I await the approval (or disapproval) of our pull request, I am going to continue looking through their issues and reconvene with my teammates on what we would like to work on next.
