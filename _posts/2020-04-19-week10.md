## Gil Yehuda's Talk

When I learned that Gil Yehuda was going to be a guest speaker in our class, I decided to do some research on him. I found his [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gil-Yehuda) page to be was incredibly resourceful – it is filled of tons of questions that he has answered. Gil is the senior director of technology strategy and open source for Verizon. I found Gil's talk to be extremely informative, especially when it came to his interview advice. What I found most valuable was when he said to speak about an open source project that the company you are interviewing for is involved in. Something that I found relatively comforting was when he spoke about *imposter syndrome*. He claims that everyone in the field has it, yet we are unaware because many are good at masking it. 

## Covid19 – Folding@home

I found this article to be very educational. I was actually a pre-med (biology) major before I made the switch to computer science, so I really enjoyed reading and learning from Folding@home. It is true that there are so many hidden information, such as chemicals, within a protein. I think their idea of creating a simulation to capture the motion of a protein and displaying a linear line of the acids is a great idea. It is s step forward to finding a solution to the coronavirus. I decided to download their software to help contribute to their project. I am excited to see their progress, especially if it can help with such a large cause that is affecting the world.

## The Chronicles of freeCodeCamp

Our team has finally made our first couple of pull requests! 

Erick made a pull request a few days ago where he corrected some typos and cleaned up a few grammatical errors so that it had a more natural tone to it. He notified us on Friday (April 17) that it was finally accepted and merged!

While Jared and I worked on [issue #38329](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38329) together, which we were able to issue a pull request this morning (April 19)! We believe that they are currently running the build and checking it as it as not been approved and merged yet.

Last but not least, I made my **very own and first** pull request! I updated the campus locations of the bootcamps that were listed in the [bootcamps.json file](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/api-server/public/json/bootcamps.json).

I have also finished my Tagalog translation for their documenation; however, I am hesitant to issue a pull request as I know that they will probably not approve of it until next year. I am going to talk to Troy about this because I know he is working on a Turkish translation. 

Lastly, I decide that I am no longer going to go through a sequential checklist. I would rather take each step with my contributions at my own pace. After listening to Gil's presentation, it really helped me learn what I want to do with this project and how I want to contribute. As Jared and I await the approval (or disapproval) of our pull request, I am going to continue looking through their issues and reconvene with my teammates on what we would like to work on next.
